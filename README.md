# KNIGBOOM Bookstore (Initial Branch)

This is the initial version of the **KNIGBOOM Bookstore** project. In this branch, I am implementing the project with **pure HTML** and **JavaScript** (without using React or other modern frontend frameworks). The focus is on using plain JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, and the backend is still integrated with the frontend.

## Features

- **Store Catalogue**: Add, search, filter, sell books.
- **Customer Library**: Manage a personal library of books, increase balance for book purchases, search for books in the library, and add/remove books.
- **Subscription**: Subscribe to news and updates about books.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **Backend**: Node.js
  - **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript (no frameworks like React, just plain JS to interact with DOM)
  - **Styling**: SCSS
  - **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
 
API
The project provides a set of RESTful API endpoints that interact with the database and frontend. Below is an overview of the main API endpoints.

Swagger Documentation
To view and test the API endpoints interactively, I have integrated Swagger UI into the project.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/balmastik/BOOKSTORE.git

3. Run the application: npm run build, npm run server
